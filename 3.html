<h2>Whole(Demo)</h2>

<img src="whole.jpg" width = "100%" alt="">

<p>Messed up, knocked down<br>
Knew how to get to me<br>
Stressed and worn out<br>
Nothing ever changes<br>
All these years I've felt so incomplete<br>
Bet you thought you took a piece of me</p>

<p>But I'm still whole, I'm still whole<br>
I'm still whole, I'm still whole</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">Left out, lonely<br>
Locked out of the party<br>
Shouting and swearing<br>
Drenched in emptiness<br>
For all these years I've felt so incomplete<br>
Really thought you took a piece of me</p>

<p>But I'm still whole, I'm still whole<br>
I'm still whole, I'm still whole</p>

<p>I was on the edge of the darkness<br>
Little did I know, that's where the light is<br>
Hidden in the cold and the heartless<br>
Thought that I was always missing something<br>
Swore that I could've lost everything<br>
But I lost nothing, nothing<br>
But I lost nothing</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">All these years I've felt so incomplete<br>
Really thought you took a piece of me</p>

<p><strong>But I'm still whole, I'm still whole</strong><br>
I'm still whole, I'm still whole<br>
I'm still whole, I'm still whole<br>
I'm still whole, I'm still whole</p>
